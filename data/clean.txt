[$4] – ORIGIN: BLEND; FAIR TRADE ORGANIC
Indian spices combine with strong Assam tea. Originally a medicinal beverage, today – due to British influence – masala chai is a recreational drink, though with large amounts of milk and sugar added to it.

/start tea MANGO
[$3.50] – ORIGIN: BLEND
Sweet mother of mango, this tea is sweet! We can attribute its sweetness either to the addition of fairy dust, or to the fact that this tea consists solely of dried fruit.
